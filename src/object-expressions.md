# Object Literals

// TODO rename these. They are not literals. Perhaps they are anon classes as in Java or anon objects
// see also https://docs.scala-lang.org/tour/singleton-objects.html
// Kotlin has object expressions and talks about both anonymous classes and anonymous objects

```azoth
var foo = new : <base> <: <interfaces> (<args...>)
{
    // constructor
    // fields
    // methods
}
```
