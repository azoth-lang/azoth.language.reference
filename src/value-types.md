# Value Types

The value types can be further divided into two subcategories. Most value types are user declared
value types. The *simple types* are predefined value types identified with keywords. The *tuple
type* is a predefined type for tuples of values.

```grammar
value_type
    : simple_type
    | tuple_type
    ;
```
