# Syntactic Analysis

The syntactic grammar of Azoth is defined throughout this reference. The terminals of the syntactic
grammar are the tokens defined by the lexical grammar. The syntactic grammar specifies how tokens
are combined to make programs.

Every source file in an Azoth program must match the `compilation_unit` production of the syntactic
grammar ([Compilation Units](namespaces.md#compilation-units)).
