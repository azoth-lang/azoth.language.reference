# Reference Capabilities

## Why Reference Capabilities

### Fearless Concurrency

### Defensive Copies

### Compile-time Constants

**TODO:** having strong and deep `const` allows all objects to be turned into constants at compile
time.

### Iterator Invalidation

### Resource Management

**TODO:** move types provide resource management with deterministic cleanup

## Basic Reference Capabilities

**TODO:** describe all the reference capabilities except `iso`, `temp`, and `init`

### Default Capabilities

## Isolated References

**TODO:** describe what an isolated reference is. How they can never be directly used and how
isolation is recovered.

## Temporary Capabilities

## Init Capabilities

## Const Types

## Flow Typing

### Freeze

### Move

**TODO:** document how moves work and leave an `id` capability behind.

## Move Types

## Lent Parameters

## Capabilities with Self and Associated Types

## Capabilities with Generics
