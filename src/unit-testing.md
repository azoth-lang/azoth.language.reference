# Unit Testing

Use Cases and Ideas

* In unit tests, allow subtyping sealed types
* In unit tests, allow overriding sealed methods
* Unit test that something doesn't compile (i.e. successfully designed to prevent something)
* Integration test (requires IO etc and thus doesn't make sense as a compile time only thing)
