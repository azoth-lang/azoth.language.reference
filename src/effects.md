# Effects

**Effects are an experimental feature for Azoth. Everything in this section is subject to change.**

Generics over effects. For example (Code from Midori, syntax may differ):

    Map<T, U, effect E>(T[] ts, Func<T, U, E> func) -> U[] E
    {
        U[] us = new U[ts.Length];
        for (int i = 0; i < ts.Length; i++) {
            us[i] = effect(E) func(ts[i]);
        }
        return us;
    }

## Other Effects

Effects are written after the return type. Any given effect is marked as `may` or `no`. Omitted
effects are inferred. Throws clauses are effects. The effects supported are:

* unsafe - whether unsafe blocks can be executed
* abort - whether a function can cause abort, note that since contracts and assertions could cause
  abort, this requires that the compiler be able to prove that the contracts are satisfied. (What if
  you could distinguish different kinds of abort? Like contracts vs arithmetic overflow?)
* allocate? - whether memory can be allocated (besides the stack?)
* io? - separate for network, file and console? other graphics?
* init? - prevent constructors from calling other methods? see [No Leaky
  Abstractions](http://joeduffyblog.com/2016/11/30/15-years-of-concurrency/)
* pure?
* out of memory and stack overflow

Notes from 2017-10-15

Just as with inferred throws, it makes sense to have all effect types inferred except at public API
boundaries where they have to be explicit. How do you support generic kinds of effects. How do you
infer that an effect doesn't propagate. The syntax for effects could be `may` or `no`. So after the
return type of a function could say `may effect` or `no effect`. Effects would be listed comma
separated for example `may abort, throw(exception1, exception2)`. In theory `throw exception1, throw
exception2` are the same.

Effects:

* throw
* abort - preconditions and post conditions could cause abort. So I need to prove that they hold to
  be able to say something won't abort
* out of memory - separate because it seems more pervasive
* arithmetic overflow cause abandonment
* unsafe - even functions marked safe that call unsafe code would be `may unsafe`
* is trusted an effect?

Do effects have a hierarchy? How fine grained are effects? For example, a method that aborts could
do so because of overflow or precondition. Are there effects for IO? Is there a different effect for
file and network IO. Given pervasive async/await, it seems like blocking shouldn't be an effect.
However, a long running computation could kind of be like blocking.

Perhaps it is valid to mark a function with a precondition as not aborting because the check of the
precondition is effectively in the calling code not in the function itself? (At call site because
some call sites prove the precondition is satisfied).
