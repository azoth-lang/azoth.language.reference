# Boolean Expression

A boolean expression is an embedded expression whose type is "`bool`" or "`bool?`".

**TODO:** maybe instead it should be an expression whose type is `bool` or that defines the `true`
operator for testing for "truthiness".

```azoth
boolean_expression
    : embedded_expression
    ;
```
